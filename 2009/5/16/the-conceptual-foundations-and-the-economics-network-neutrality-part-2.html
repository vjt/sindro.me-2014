      <h1>The conceptual foundations and the economics network neutrality [Part 2] - 14 May 2009, Rome</h1>
      <p>This is the second part of my recap of the <a href="http://www.nnsquad.it/">nnsquad.it</a> convention held in Rome on May 14, 2009, and hosted by the <span class="caps">ICT</span> consultants foundation <a href="http://www.fub.it/">Fondazione Ugo Bordoni</a>.</p>


	<p>In the <a href="the-conceptual-foundations-and-the-economics-network-neutrality-rome.html">first part</a> I described the morning session, dedicated to the definition of Network neutrality, and how global economics  can cope with it. The afternoon was dedicated to more technical talks, and I had the occasion to hear telcos spokesmen remarks over the current situation and possible future developments.</p>


	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="../../../assets/sindro.me/2009/5/16/rospigliosi-palace-statues-room-nnsquad-convention.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p><a name="continue"></a>
The first speech started at 2.15PM and was held by Prof. <a href="http://www.sede-cremona.polimi.it/organizzazione/dettagli_docente.php?id_nav=6582&amp;aa=2008&amp;sede_cds=cr&amp;k_docente=176618&amp;n_docente=TRECORDI%20VITTORIO">Vittorio Trecordi</a> (slides available <a href="http://www.fub.it/files/Slide_Trecordi_14_05_09.pdf">here</a>). He introduced it by stating that net neutrality could possibly contrast with the economic development and security assessment, because of the wiretapping needed for the latter, tap that is strongly against the individual freedom to communicate.</p>


	<p>Strangely (or maybe not) enough, no mention was made to current ways to bypass both wiretapping and localization of communicating peers: I&#8217;m referring to the <a href="http://tor.eff.org/">tor project</a>, the most known bastion that guarantees privacy and is <a href="http://www.torproject.org/torusers.html.en">currently used by journalists working in &quot;hot&quot; areas</a>, among many others.</p>


	<p>Another point about legislation is that it isn&#8217;t the same in all countries, althought the Internet is spread all over the world; moreover we should define on what networks we should assess neutrality, because not necessarily an IP network is connected to the Internet (think about <span class="caps">ISP</span>-owned walled gardens).</p>


	<p>Also, again on the Quality of Service: Trecordi stated the Internet succeeded because of its &quot;hourglass model&quot; and &#8220;the capability to decouple communications services and network infrastructure&#8221;, but QoS requirements (e.g. for VoIP) stress the protocol stack pile, moreover where  the network pipes are &#8220;overbooked&#8221;. Furthermore, even overprovisioning fails, because of the decentralized architecture of the Internet, and bottlenecks are mainly located in <a href="http://www.mix-it.net/">interconnection points between ISPs</a>.</p>


	<p>So, the Internet is a best-effort platform, where an <span class="caps">ISP</span> can&#8217;t control how its customers&#8217; packets will be treated when crossing its borders, and reach a geographically far provider. In this area reside the business model of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">content delivery networks</a>, that we&#8217;re transparently using everyday to access heavily trafficked <a href="http://facebook.com/">web</a> <a href="http://www.cnn.com/">sites</a>, and that also caused some funny misunderstandings in the past, when <a href="http://www.akamai.com/">akamai</a> started proxying the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">microsoft</a> with <a href="http://squid-cache.org/">squid</a> running on Linux, and <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/">netcraft</a> shown in its statistics that <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4962">microsoft servers are running on linux</a> :).</p>


	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="../../../assets/sindro.me/2009/5/16/akamai-how-content-delivery-network-works.png" alt="" /></p>


	<p style="text-align:right;"><cite>Source: <a href="http://www.akamai.net/">Akamai</a></cite></p>


	<p>Apart from that funny joke (from 2001), <span class="caps">CDN</span> shorten the routing path between users and static content of a service, using geographically distributed data centers running <a href="http://varnish.projects.linpro.no/">Varnish</a> (or equivalent software) and a geolocation-enabled <span class="caps">DNS</span> server such as <a href="http://www.powerdns.com/">PowerDNS</a>. This way, when some random client tries to resolve an hostname, the <span class="caps">DNS</span> answers with the nearest datacenter virtual IP address, and then serves content off the cache.</p>


	<p>This are approaches that try to mitigate the best-effort nature of the Internet, but maybe there are better solutions. <span class="caps">NGN</span> aims to be one of those, by providing multiple network pipes dedicated to deliver different types of network traffic, with their specific QoS needs. Especially in peering connections between ISPs, which should provide SLAs to assess a global (albeit best-effort :) QoS between networks. Fully guaranteed QoS was and will be assured <strong>only</strong> into walled gardens.</p>


	<p>Another approach to shorten routing paths and single-point network load is to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">distributed hash table</a>, or <span class="caps">DHT</span> in short, that implements a decentralized distributed infrastructure upon which can be built efficient services like distributed file systems, peer-to-peer sharing, and in general content distribution systems. <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/">bittorrent</a> is an example of <span class="caps">DHT</span>, as is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">Kademlia</a> used by the popular <a href="http://emule-project.net/">emule</a> file-sharing software. Another example is <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-p2psip-sip-01"><span class="caps">RELOAD</span></a>, currently (still) in draft status, used to implement peer-to-peer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol"><span class="caps">SIP</span></a>, and so a decentralized VoIP infrastructure with no big name behind it. I&#8217;m no surprised that <span class="caps">RELOAD</span> and <span class="caps">P2PSIP</span> weren&#8217;t mentioned in the talk.</p>


	<p>Of course neither NGNs neither <span class="caps">P2P</span>/CDN technologies will cover the entire internet in no time: the good &#8216;ol net will <em>float</em> upon these new technologies and on legacy ones (such as IPv4) in the next years, because changing network infrastructure imposes heavy costs on ISPs. One may ask whether also content providers should 
contribute to network infrastructure development, as they&#8217;re the ones that would benefit from wider BW and lower latency. Prof. Trecordi said yes, <a href="http://precursorblog.com/content/google-uses-21-times-more-bandwidth-it-pays-first-ever-research-study">google uses 21 times more bandwidth it pays for</a>. Hell. LaTeX isn&#8217;t enough to make content, mr Ph.D. <a href="http://precursorblog.com/content/google-uses-21-times-more-bandwidth-it-pays-first-ever-research-study#comment-4558">This comment</a> explains my point of view on this matter, and was also exposed later by a member of the audience.</p>


	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="../../../assets/sindro.me/2009/5/16/bandwidth-usage-p2p.png" alt="" /></p>


	<p style="text-align:right;"><cite>Source: <a href="http://www.fub.it/files/Slide_Trecordi_14_05_09.pdf">Trecordi&#8217;s slides</a></cite></p>


	<p>Whichever networking infrastructure we may adopt in the future, we cannot prescind from a plain fact: just a minority of the users will consume the majority of the bandwidth.. as happened with Napster in 2000, when because of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Fanning's">Shawn Fanning</a> software was allegedly consuming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster#cite_ref-2">80% of the aggregate external bandwidth</a> of his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_University">college</a>. Considering this scenario, the speaker argued that it is reasonable for ISPs to put caps on specific services (file sharing über alles) to limit the &#8220;all you can eat&#8221; model, because the few users making a massive use actually could impact the ones using fewer resources. I&#8217;ve got mixed opinions about this, because ISPs too often cross the line.. and reasonable caps can too easily become <strong>unacceptable</strong> ones.</p>


	<p>Then the professor talked about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proactive_network_Provider_Participation_for_P2P"><span class="caps">P4P</span></a> as a possible mitigation factor of network congestion. <span class="caps">P4P</span> means that ISPs collaborate with bittorrent clients implementors to develop custom versions to <em>optimize</em> P2P connections between customers. What is this <em>optimization</em> about? In short, to not favor the fastest clients, but the <em>nearest</em> ones, in terms of routing hops. This happens via a dedicated iTracker set up by the <span class="caps">ISP</span> (ouch!) that contains additional information about the physical location of clients, and can thus direct <span class="caps">P2P</span> connections to the nearest ones.</p>


	<p>The <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/uncovering-the-dark-side-of-p4p-080824/">dark side of <span class="caps">P4P</span></a>, as Ernesto&#8217;s Torrentfreak founder points out, is that it can open a big can of worms, because the <span class="caps">P4P</span> working group <a href="http://www.awesomehighlighter.com/page/display/S4E2UjZZH">&quot;includes some prominent members of the entertainment industry and well known anti-piracy lobbyists&quot;</a> (sorry but the highlighter didn&#8217;t work well on this page). I&#8217;m unable to say Ernesto is  wrong, also because of statement like the one Sony pictures <span class="caps">CEO</span> said yesterday May 15 2009: <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/05/15/sony-pictures-ceo-no.html">&quot;<cite>nothing good has come from the internet, period.</cite>&quot;</a>. Heh. No comments.</p>


	<p>Then, <span class="caps">DPI</span> (Deep Packet Inspection). Can ISPs use it? And for which purposes? Security? Well, it could work, as long as automated procedures filter <span class="caps">SPAM</span> and Virii out of residential networks, ok.. but AT&#38;T has used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narus">Narus</a> and split fibers to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection#United_States">identify and collect VoIP calls</a> data bits, <span class="caps">DPI</span> can also be used to deliver <a href="http://www.itworld.com/internet/66943/att-sends-mixed-message-behavioral-advertising">targeted advertising</a>, and can be abused way too easily: In Italy we had the infamous <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/t/business/telecom-italia-embroiled-in-new-espionage-scandal-999">Tiger Team</a> espionage scandal, so we need precise rules to regulate these possibly evil technologies, and make sure ISPs respect them. We need a huge dose of <strong>Faith</strong>, I&#8217;d guess.</p>

	<h2>Round table with telcos spokesmen</h2>


	<p>This was the really interesting part of the event: seeing men that represent telcos speak to each other about Internet matters, and referring each other as the companies they represent. Quite funny, considering the quite complicated status quo here in Italy (governative concessions, last mile cables owned by a single company for historic reasons, and so on).</p>


	<p>The involved parties (and condensed key points) were:</p>

E.g. a PC with an <span class="caps">HSDPA</span> module which kind of access does provide? Broadband? <span class="caps">UMTS</span>?

Also, our company broadcasts <a href="http://www.rai.it/"><span class="caps">RAI</span></a> television via <span class="caps">DVBH</span>, but <span class="caps">RAI</span> does not broadcast itself.

		<li>We could define a greatest common divisor in a service set that gives neutrality and doesn&#8217;t need QoS. Because IP is a best-effort protocol, no one should invest in network resources not efficiently used (because of file sharing, editor&#8217;s note).</li>
		<li>In the end, we need a sane and precise regulation, because in a multiplayer business context everyone tries to feather his own nest (and I hate this status quo, editor&#8217;s note)</li>

We need 4G, we need fiber, and the state should promote these issues (and not demonize the Internet, editor&#8217;s note).</p>


	<h2>Politics</h2>


<div style="float:right;"><img src="../../../assets/sindro.me/2009/5/16/gentiloni.jpg" alt="" /></div> 

	<p><a href="http://www2.paologentiloni.it/">Paolo Gentiloni</a>, former telecommunications minister, said that the State is not just watching: it&#8217;ll have a prominent role in the future. He said that Microsoft <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/microsoft_europe_internet_usage_will_overtake_trad.php">reported</a> that in 2010 internet usage will overtake traditional TV, and as such work load on the Public Administration will rise, also because the PA missed it (hey this reminds me when Microsoft&#8217;s Ballmer stated that <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2331369,00.asp">we missed the internet</a>). He also reminded of a <a href="http://borsaitaliana.it.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idITMIE52C0K820090313">Caio Report</a> that promises <a href="http://ict.asca.it/interna.php?articolo=BANDA_LARGA__ECCO_IL_RAPPORTO_CAIO&amp;idnotizia=1085&amp;sezione=news">to cover 99% of the population with <span class="caps">DSL</span> or fiber</a> within 2011, if works will start in June 2009 (we&#8217;ll see, editor&#8217;s note).</p>


<blockquote>
<strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span></strong>: The Caio Report was <a href="http://tr.im/lYqC">leaked on wikileaks</a> on May 15, 2009 (thanks <a href="http://blog.quintarelli.it/blog/2009/05/online-il-rapporto-caio.html">Quinta</a> for sharing).
</blockquote>

	<p>It&#8217;s difficult for EU to implement infrastructure development practices like Asian ones, where the State takes decisions and businesses execute them.. because in a capitalistic world the only thing that counts is <span class="caps">ROI</span>. We need to find a sane equilibrium for everyone, and we&#8217;re working on this.</p>


	<h2>Conclusions</h2>


	<p>In a nutshell, the event was interesting, a bit pleonastic because the same topics were carried over and over through the day, and it was an assessment of the current situation (un-chartered territory) but at least I heard politicians say &#8220;yes the internet is important, is valuable, and is worth pushing&#8221;. I don&#8217;t remember how many times I said these words in the past.</p>


	<p>Hope you had a nice read, and congratulations that you made it!</p>
