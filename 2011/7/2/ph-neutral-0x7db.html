	<h2><a href="http://ph-neutral.darklab.org/talks/sj.html">Sniffjoke &#8211; a sniffer-evasion toolkit</a></h2>


	<p>High capacity sniffers used in big cos and on border national gateways that collect user generated traffic on order to find possibly &#8220;criminal&#8221; patterns are today generally available for bandwidth to the 10Gbps, there will be soon appliances that&#8217;ll process streams of 100Gbps.
Sniffjoke, by <a href="http://twitter.com/sniffjoke">vecna</a> and <a href="http://www.evilaliv3.org/">evilaliv3</a> is a tool that can inject into <span class="caps">TCP</span> connections outsider packets that will fool the intercepting sniffer but with no remarkable effect on the receiver. these packets for instance trick the sniffer into thinking that the connection has been reset even it is not true &#8211; by injecting a wrong-checksummed <span class="caps">RST</span> or a packet with a <span class="caps">TTL</span> less than 1 of the hop count &#8211; or try to consume its processing power by using known vendor-specific interpretations of the <span class="caps">TCP RFC</span>.

	<h2><a href="http://ph-neutral.darklab.org/talks/wlan.html"><span class="caps">WLAN</span> router horror stories</a></h2>


	<p>Did you ever woder what happens when the wireless network password is directly tied to the device <span class="caps">MAC</span> address, from which it can be inferred because it is part of the essid? horror stories, as the an Austrian (<a href="http://twitter.com/sviehb">ViBi</a>) and a German (<a href="http://twitter.com/5m7x">5M7X</a>) researchers showed us. many carriers who sell wifi equipment ship it with similar vulnerabilities, as also mayhem and cyrax show us in <a href="http://www.video.mediaset.it/video/iene/puntata/227136/viviani-haker-e-wifi.html">this video</a> (italian only)</p>


	<p>We&#8217;re talking about a technology whose potential is not maximized, as a result leads to flawed the security measures, because of bad engineering and misleading instructions: some wifi apparatus manuals even recommended the user to never fiddle with the configuration and leave the default passwords in place. clever.
Other examples of bad engineering include making the network key the last 4 bytes of the internal eth <span class="caps">MAC</span> address and then broadcasting that <span class="caps">MAC</span> via a multicast packet sent to 224.0.1.0 (<a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/business/telecommunication/productInfo.do?ctgry_group=14&amp;ctgry_type=32&amp;b2b_prd_id=217">Samsung <span class="caps">G3200</span></a> / <span class="caps">G2210</span> / <span class="caps">G3220</span>).</p>


	<p>Other companies, such as the synchron who produce the <a href="http://dsl.vodafone.de/hilfe/index.php?aktion=anzeigen&amp;rubrik=004&amp;id=269">easybox</a> has a patented way to provide a key recognition method, and direct correspondence between the mac and the key seed. eventually, there are even companies who sell their devices with the management <span class="caps">SSHD</span> open on the external interface, and who base the network key entirely on the internal <span class="caps">MAC</span>. Couple it with default passwords and you get the picture.</p>


	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="../../../assets/sindro.me/2011/7/2/wifi-armory.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>If you want to know more, you should get some <a href="http://net-wifi.it/">armory</a> and either reverse engineer the algorithms yourself, or participate to security conferences and ask the researchers for the slides :-). Once the industry will be ready, all the details will be revealed.</p>


	<h2>Hacking <span class="caps">TETRA</span></h2>


	<p>Held by Harald Welte (<a href="http://twitter.com/laf0rge">@laf0rge</a>), member of the <a href="http://gnumonks.de/">gnumonks.de</a> crew, the talk described a terrestrial radio communication technology that is similar to <span class="caps">GSM</span> but runs on lower frequencies of the spectrum, thus achieving wider coverage with less transceivers. <span class="caps">TETRA</span> employs ways to authenticate and encrypt communications, features a signaling channel over 140-chars messages are exchanged and identifies each user on the network using the match between the subscriber number and the terminal one.</p>


	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TETRA"><span class="caps">TETRA</span></a> is widely deployed over the world as a communication medium for public transport, public safety, firefighters, etc. it is a technology suitable for these uses, but laforge correctly reminded us that even if the tools allow us to implement secure networks, often the implementations of such tools is ineffective and prone to breakage.</p>


	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="../../../assets/sindro.me/2011/7/2/laf0rge.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>He showed us how the signaling on the network works. He started by first showing us packet dumps in wireshark, thanks to chinese hackers who wrote the dissectors. He was also able to associate to a tetra network used by <span class="caps">BVG</span>, the german public transportation system, and listen to a call between the headquarters and all train drivers: the former was asking the latters to push a button contemporarily. Yes, sir: in the 21st century you still need people to do that. Awesome.
If you want to build your own, you should first learn how radio communication works, buy yourself a <a href="http://www.funcubedongle.com/">FUNcube</a> dongle and check out the <a href="http://osmocomtetra/">OsmocomTETRA</a> project. An introduction is available on <a href="http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/TETRA-digital-radio-now-for-everyone-1254088.html">heise.de</a>.</p>


	<h2>Printer Hacking</h2>


	<p>Find vulnerability into a printer management interface, write a java applet that exploits it,  define hooks to drive it from Javascript, and your web-based printer vulnerability scanner is done!</p>


	<p>I missed the first part of the talk, so I don&#8217;t have the details, but as the speaker told me later when I asked him how it all fitted together, &#8220;it&#8217;s everything on the paper!&#8221; so just <span class="caps">RTFM</span> <a href="http://andreicostin.com/papers/Conf - EuSecWest2010_AndreiCostin_HackingPrintersForFunAndProfit_full.pdf">here</a> :)</p>


	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="../../../assets/sindro.me/2011/7/2/naif-sleeping.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<h2><a href="http://ph-neutral.darklab.org/talks/chip_and_pin.html">Chip &#38; <span class="caps">PIN</span> is definitely broken</a></h2>


	<p>Moving on in the list of badly-implemented technologies, nowadays credit / debit cards are vulnerable to a typical downgrade attack when it comes to validating the <span class="caps">PIN</span>. There are different types of chips, ones that only allow plaintext authentication between the <span class="caps">POS</span> and the chip, others that employ a challenge-response mechanism, and almost every one of them allow the <span class="caps">PIN</span> to be validated online with the bank.</p>


	<p>No matter what, the <span class="caps">SIM</span> exposes an interface to the card readers, that can be queried and whose communication can be eavesdropped by an intercepting device. Because cards must be backwards-compatible with existing POSes and viceversa, such an intercepting device is able to alter the advertised capabilities of the card and force the <span class="caps">POS</span> to use plaintext authentication, and then intercepting the pin as the user types it.</p>


	<p>Such a skimmer is a 4&#215;4cm device, that can be installed <strong>inside</strong> a <code>POS</code> or an <code>ATM</code>, thus possibly going unnoticed for a long period of time. And even if there are insurances that cover you against these frauds, if you&#8217;re a frequent traveller, you can hard time in demonstrating you were a victim, both because the card number and pin match, and because this is now considered as a &#8220;secure&#8221; technology that cannot be broken.</p>


	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="../../../assets/sindro.me/2011/7/2/inversepath.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>Thanks to Andrea Barisani and Davide Bianco for making us aware of the downgrade flaw. If you want to know more, here are their slide published on their company site, <a href="http://inversepath.com/">inversepath.com</a>.</p>


	<h2><a href="http://ph-neutral.darklab.org/talks/freebsd.html">FreeBSD kernel exploitation</a></h2>


	<p>As years go by, stack smashing is still alive and powerful, as <a href="http://twitter.com/_argp">argp</a> explained during his talk. <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3531"><span class="caps">CVE</span>-2008-3531</a> is a known vulnerability of the FreeBSD kernel that allows code execution in kernel space, whilst the <span class="caps">UMA</span> &#8211; FreeBSD&#8217;s memory allocator &#8211; <a href="http://www.phrack.org/issues.html?issue=66&amp;id=8#article">has known flaws in it as well</a>.</p>


	<p>Without going into deeper details, the main issue here is the &#8220;if it ain&#8217;t broken, don&#8217;t fix it&#8221; approach employed by many system administrators when it comes to production machines: as a result, they do not get updated for years. Maybe it&#8217;s not broken today (if ever, ya&#8217;now 0dayz?) but it will be broken tomorrow, and you&#8217;ll get pwned if you do not keep up to date. <span class="caps">WORD</span>.</p>

	<h2>Advances in win32 <span class="caps">ASLR</span> evasion</h2>


	<p>When I think about Microsoft products, I always feel that they&#8217;re not built to be used by people, because it looks to me that coders who write them never care about using them in the first place. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">They do not eat their own dog food</a>. just go on and try to use IE developer tools and you&#8217;ll get the point.</p>


	<p>Their software is written for business, it must match some higher-order requirement agreed by some random manager 7 layers up in the hierarchy, and very often it fails to implement them correctly. Thus, as <a href="http://twitter.com/not_me">JF</a> pointed out during the talk &#8220;Microsoft has spent a lot of money fixing the exploitation problem, but they only created more of them&#8221;. Word, dword and qword! :-)</p>


	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASLR"><span class="caps">ASLR</span></a> is a mitigating factor for exploits that assume the return address of vulnerable code lies in at a well-known address in memory. These locations are used to compute where to write the shellcode in order to trigger its execution after exploitation. If the return address gets randomized (thus Address Space Layout Randomization), then the exploit will just crash the vulnerable software by making it reference an address outside its space.</p>


	<p>Problem is that, for some obscure side effect, for each 16 threads you create, if their base address is even (<code>0x02xxxxxx</code>, <code>0x04xxxxxx</code>), 13 of them will end up being based at a known location, thus making <span class="caps">ASLR</span> ineffective and bypassed. <strong><span class="caps">PWN</span></strong>!</p>


	<p>Check JF slides out <a href="../../../assets/sindro.me/2011/7/2/Advances_in_Win32_ASLR_Evasion.pdf">here</a> &#8211; thanks for sharing <a href="http://twitter.com/not_me">@not_me</a>!</p>


	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="../../../assets/sindro.me/2011/7/2/jf.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>JF apologized at least 4 times before ending up closing its laptop and ending the presentation with vodka and gin, because he said that he did not do a good work in explaining but, as I also told him later, he was more than effective: it&#8217;s not easy at all to understand how all the side effects played together. Only he that was on this stuff for months was able to see the patterns in addresses and convey a successful exploitation of an <span class="caps">ASLR</span>-protected process. Enlightening!</p>


	<h2><a href="http://ph-neutral.darklab.org/talks/lfh.html">Modern heap exploitation using the low-fragmentation heap</a></h2>


	<p>I&#8217;m no MM guy and I didn&#8217;t get most of the concepts of the talk, but its abstract is very explanatory:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p><em>Heap memory management has matured over time, but with complex new code comes new opportunity for exploitation. This presentation will focus on understanding the Low Fragmentation heap on Windows 7 (32-bit). After a foundation of integral concepts is laid, new exploitation techniques will be thoroughly discussed. Finally, we will use this new found knowledge to leverage <strong>supposed</strong> non-exploitable vulnerabilities. Specifically we will cover a case study showing how to craft an exploit for the <span class="caps">IIS FTP 7</span>.5 <strong>denial of service</strong> (<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2010/12/22/assessing-an-iis-ftp-7-5">http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2010/12/22/assessing-an-iis-ftp-7-5-= unauthenticated-denial-of-service-vulnerability.aspx</a>-= unauthenticated-denial-of-service-vulnerability.aspx), resulting in full control of <span class="caps">EIP</span>.</em></p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>What is interesting is that in order to use a memory allocation optimization subsystem to do what you want, you have to mix and match 7 different attack primitives, understand thoroughly how the block allocations are made and how they interact with the host <span class="caps">CPU</span>. As well as battle with all the side effects in order to write in the program counter the address you want to execute. “@You say <span class="caps">JMP</span>, we say what addr@”, a T-shirt was correctly stating in front of me. :-)</p>


	<p>Incredibly complicated as it sounds, <a href="http://twitter.com/nudehaberdasher">Chris Valasek</a> was able to find, exploit and explain the vulnerabilities, with a mental exercise that is both brilliant than inspirating: always dig deeper, and you&#8217;ll be able to reach any goal.</p>


	<p><a href="https://prezi.com/secure/73006c52fbfde4eddf935b5e09103df23580c39d/">Here are Chris’ slides</a>, but you’ll have to enable Flash unfortunately.</p>


	<h2>Exploiting the Hard-Working <span class="caps">DWARF</span>: Trojans with no Native Executable Code</h2>


	<p>Could you ever imagine that in every <span class="caps">GCC</span>-compiled binary may lie a complete virtual machine subsystem, that gets invoked on every call/ret and has the ability to read and write the heap and every cpu register? indeed it is, and it&#8217;s called <span class="caps">DWARF</span>, a debugging instrumentation used by <span class="caps">GDB</span> to help the developer debug his/her software.</p>


	<p><em>“It’s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWARF"><span class="caps">DWARF</span></a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format"><span class="caps">ELF</span></a> story&#8230;”</em> LOL! :-D.</p>


	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="../../../assets/sindro.me/2011/7/2/dwarf.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>What&#8217;s interesting is also that <span class="caps">DWARF</span> code is not considered by analysis tools as being part of the object code of a binary, thus making it an injection vector to attach trojans to a binary. Moreover, <span class="caps">DWARF</span> is platform and architecture independent, being a finite-state machine on its own: a <span class="caps">DWARF</span>-based trojan can be used over multiple platforms and attached to any <span class="caps">ELF</span> binary.</p>


	<p>If <span class="caps">DWARF</span> code is present, it gets executed for each function called and on each return, as the stack gets unwinded, and yes you can read and write the <span class="caps">CPU</span> and on the heap. Neat. For all the details, check <a href="http://ph-neutral.darklab.org/talks/tr2011-680.pdf">the whitepaper</a> out.</p>


	<p>Here we see an example of hobby-ism and poor project management on the <span class="caps">GCC</span> side &#8211; no offense intended of course &#8211; but such a crafted and complex subsystem ends up being available in the vast majority of OSs, possibly making up an infection vector.</p>


	<p>I infer this because <span class="caps">DWARF</span> is an obscure, undocumented, cargo-culted piece of code written because somehow today and tomorrow the <span class="caps">GDB</span> devs needed instrumentations, and <span class="caps">GCC</span> devs built in an excessively powerful tool to support them, but said tool can then be abused and no one really know how the first releases work &#8211; unless you skim through random posts on the <span class="caps">GCC</span> mailing list. More recent releases are pretty documented, <a href="http://dwarfstd.org/Download.php">though</a>.</p>


	<p>Funnily enough, I think to support <span class="caps">GDB</span>, even the <a href="http://llvm.org/"><span class="caps">LLVM</span> compiler infrastructure</a>, built with clean design from the ground up, uses <span class="caps">DWARF</span>! That said, the moral of the story is that ugly hacks today, will call you for trouble tomorrow &#8211; or the next day.</p>


	<h2>Party! (<a href="http://82.94.215.218/download/ph-neutral/0x7db/DJ/">Music Here</a>)</h2>


	<blockquote>
		<p>- &#8220;hey man, are you the guy behind the openbsd box acting as an host AP for the ph wifi network?&#8221;<br/>
- &#8220;yeah, I am&#8221;<br/>

	</blockquote>


	<p>Kudos to the OpenBSD panda, that didn&#8217;t give me a shell, but illustrated me how the dorepanda access point &#8220;cluster&#8221; works, creating a network that spans all the 802.11b/g and n spectrums. It load balances clients between the APs, using cryptography to verify the AP identity and trying to prevent eavesdropping.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>- &#8220;man, you are actually a grey beard at a security conference!&#8221;<br/>
- &#8221;... so what?!&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>... and then you talk with a 20-yrs experienced <span class="caps">DBA</span> that tells you &#8220;<em>Oracle is flawed by design</em>&#8221; and you chat with him about how the security scenario has changed over the years.</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>- &#8220;nothing really changed, it just got more complicated along the way&#8221;<br/>
- &#8220;you mean, the bottom line is always you have to snatch some shellcode in memory and then find a mean to execute it?&#8221;<br/>
- &#8220;exactly &#8211; you may have an NX bit, <span class="caps">ASLR</span> and canaries, but there&#8217;s alway a way around it.&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>A good sysadm <a href="http://signalos.org/">friend of mine</a> told me similarly, in terms of &#8220;as long as I read enough documentation, I&#8217;m able to set up and deploy whatever system. no challenges anymore.&#8221;</p>


	<p>To me, confs like this one make you wonder, think and activate mental circuitry that stimulate your passion: you see brilliant humans solving tricky problems, walking deeply into details and actually learning new things in the process. human beings whose model of the world includes sequences of interactions happening inside the machine. Like a skilled netadmin recognizes AS numbers from netblocks, a kernel hacker learns to recognize portions of the address space: he/she literally breathes within the operating system.</p>


	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="../../../assets/sindro.me/2011/7/2/party2.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>It amazes me how I found strong matches of Jeff Hawkins&#8217; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Intelligence-Jeff-Hawkins/dp/0805074562">theory of intelligence</a> (<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_hawkins_on_how_brain_science_will_change_computing.html"><span class="caps">TED</span> video</a>) in hackers&#8217; minds. I talked about the <a href="http://numenta.com/htm-overview/htm-algorithms.php">HTMs</a> <a href="http://numenta.com/htm-overview/education.php">paper</a> to the folks I met, and I was surprised no one of them knew about a technology aimed at building intelligent machines by reimplementing the human brain&#8217;s cortical algorithm in silicon.
For instance, Chris Valasek and JF talks demonstrate the basis of expertise: more and more you receive inputs from a context, the more your brain will be able to see deeper and complicated patterns, because they get moved lower in the cortex hierarchy, whose job is to recognize details &#8211; as they did with <span class="caps">ASLR</span> and the low-fragmentation heap.</p>

- &#8220;so you must definitely work for Microsoft!&#8221;<br/>
- &#8220;ahem, no&#8230;&#8221;<br/>
- &#8220;ah, ok so my assumption was incorrect. sorry for bothering! :D&#8221;<br/></p>

	<p>At 5:15, it&#8217;s really better to get to bed, waiting for the next good morning!</p>

	<h2>Day 3 &#8211; <a href="http://ph-neutral.darklab.org/talks/newav.html" title="by natural language training">98% Zero-Day Virus Detection</a></h2>


	<p>After such a party, both the <a href="http://ph-neutral.darklab.org/talks/jes.html">social engineering</a> and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/nbrito01/phneutral-0x7db-exploit-next-generation">Exploit Next Generation++</a> talks were a bit foggy, I ever failed to recognized the metasploit source code language (ahem). :-)</p>


	<p>Then shirtie (<a href="http://twitter.com/skjortan">@skjortan</a>) on stage illustrated how you can use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_classifier">Bayesian</a> / <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_entropy_classifier"><span class="caps">MAXENT</span></a> classifier to identify unknown, 0day malware.</p>


	<p>Exactly like an anti-spam filter catches spam by first analyzing a training set, identifying the recurring patterns and then matching them with novel data, malware as well as spam has typical features that can be used to find it. For instance, the presence of a reference to the <code>CreateProcess</code> API or the absence of the <code>&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_FDIV_bug"&gt;_check_fdiv&lt;/a&gt;</code> one, to whether the binary is <a href="http://upx.sourceforge.net/"><span class="caps">UPX</span>-packed</a> or not.</p>


	<p>The technology looks effective, it is not a replacement of a signature-based AV rather it is an augmentation, because it is prone to false positives, but it is the only that identifies unknown, 0-day malware &#8211; the one for which no signatures exist.</p>


	<h2>Offensive <span class="caps">XSLT</span></h2>


	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="../../../assets/sindro.me/2011/7/2/xslt.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p><code>XSLT</code> is a language used to transform <span class="caps">XML</span> documents into another form, and it is a turing-complete language executed either in the server or in the client context. it is used both by content management systems and in client-side applications, the most prominent example being the index of a subversion repository.</p>


	<p>Because <code>XSLT</code> is a (functional) programming language, it offers means to read and write files and to execute code. If the user input is not sanitized and/or the <span class="caps">XSLT</span> engine exposed, it can be used to pwn a machine. Of course, the abusable features can be turned off if they&#8217;re not needed, or alternatively wrapped with a secure <span class="caps">API</span> if they are.
Check <a href="http://twitter.com/Agarri_FR">Nicolas Gregoire’s</a> slides out <a href="http://prezi.com/y_fuybfudgnd/offensive-xslt/">here</a>. Liferay users, <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1571">you’ve been warned</a> :-)</p>
